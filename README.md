# pyAudioFX

**pyAudioFX** is a desktop application for experimenting with audio effects in Python. It provides a live-coding environment where you can write Python scripts using [Pedalboard](https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard) plugins, process audio files, batch-process folders, and even monitor live audio input with your effects in real time.

## Usage

1. **Write your effect chain** in the editor, e.g.:
    ```python
    from pedalboard import Chorus, Reverb
    effected = [Chorus(), Reverb(room_size=0.6)]
    ```
2. **Load an audio file** (WAV, AIFF, FLAC).
3. **Compile** your script and preview the processed ("wet") or original ("dry") audio.
4. **Enable live input** to process your microphone or input device in real time.
5. **Batch process** a folder of audio files with your effect chain.

---

## Batch Processing

- Click the **Batch** button.
- Choose a folder, set a suffix for processed files, and the number of worker threads.
- All compatible audio files in the folder (and subfolders) will be processed.

---

## Live Input

- Select your input device from the toolbar.
- Your input will be routed through your effect chain and played back in real time.
- To stop live monitoring, select "None" in the device dropdown.

## Saving & Loading

- **Scripts:** Use the toolbar to open/save your Python effect scripts.
- **Audio:** Load audio files for preview and processing.
